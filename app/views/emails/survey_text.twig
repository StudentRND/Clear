Hi {{ registration.first_name }},

I really hope you enjoyed CodeDay this past weekend!

My goal with CodeDay is to create an environment where you can meet cool people, work on interesting projects, learn something new, and have a lot of fun. To do that, I need your help.

At the first CodeDay in 2011, I personally talked to each of the participants during the event. As we've started bringing CodeDay into more and more cities nationwide, however, that's become impossible to do.

That's why I'm reaching out to you now, {{ registration.first_name }}. Could you take 5 minutes to tell us about your experience at CodeDay -- what went well, and what we could have done better for you?

---

My team has put together a quick survey here, and we'd be really appreciative if you'd take it: {{ survey }}?event={{ registration.event.webname }}

---

Survey aside, if you had a bad experience, want to let us know about a staff member who did a great job, or have anything else to say, I welcome replies to this email. (Yes, this email was sent by a computer, but I personally read and reply to any replies!)

Again, thank you so much for attending CodeDay! We all really put our hearts into making this a great event, and it's all because we love getting to know you and seeing the cool things you make.
