Hi {{ registration.first_name }},

We just wanted to take a moment and remind you that you registered for a ticket for CodeDay {{ registration.event.name }}, this Saturday at noon.
{% if registration.event.venue %}

This event is hosted at {{ registration.event.venue.name }}
{{ registration.event.venue_address_1 }}
{% if registration.event.venue_address_2 %}
{{ registration.event.venue_address_2 }}
{% endif %}
{{ registration.event.venue.city }} {{ registration.event.venue.state }} {{ registration.event.venue.postal }}
{% endif %}

**Special thanks to our sponsors** 

We also wanted to take a moment to thank our sponsors. You'll hear more about these awesome organizations this weekend,
but we wanted to give a special shoutout to Splunk (http://splunk.com), Intellectual Ventures (http://intellectualventures.com), 
and LexisNexis Risk Solutions (http://lexisnexis.com) for sponsoring 
CodeDay nationally. 

In addition, your event is sponsored locally by [sponsor_1] (sponsor_1_website), [sponsor_2] (sponsor_2_website]).

Without these sponsors, CodeDay wouldn't be possible. 

**Perks for CodeDay Attendees**

[if_amazon]

Amazon is giving all advanced students at {{ registration.event.name }} $100 in free Amazon Web Services credit. 

You can learn more at: https://aws.amazon.com/activate/event/springcs15/, and look out for an email with more information about this 
CodeDay attendee perk sometime this weekend.

(If you don't know what this means, don't worry about it for now.)

See you tomorrow, and please let us know if you have any questions. 

(Please do not bring this email to CodeDay, we will check you in by name.)
