       absolute latest! The kickoff starts at noon. If you aren't planning to be there for the kickoff, or don't want
       to give a speech, we'll tell the students what you do using the description you've provided.</p>
    
    <p><strong>If you'd like to distribute swag</strong> at the event, we recommend arriving around 11am to get set up.</p>
