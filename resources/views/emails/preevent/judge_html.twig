    <h2>About Judging</h2>

    <p>CodeDay is judged very differently from a lot of similar events. We don't put any focus on business model, and
       generally like to reward teams who tried something new, and who pushed themselves outside of what they could
       already do.</p>
    <p>We ask you to consider only the following criteria when evaluating teams:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Creativity</li>
        <li>Effort</li>
        <li>Polish</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Please Arrive by 9am!</h3>
    <p>The morning's judging schedule is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>9am: pre-judging</li>
        <li>10am: presentations</li>
        <li>11am: awards</li>
    </ul>
