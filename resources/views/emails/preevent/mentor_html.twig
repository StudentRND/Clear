    <h3>Reminder: CodeDay Isn't a Hackathon</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Many students will be total beginners. Expect to help students who are confused about basic concepts.</li>
        <li>Beginners will be afraid to ask you for help. You will need to be proactive in asking teams about problems.</li>
        <li>Teach students to think like a developer. Before answering a question, ask "how does your code work" and
            "what have you Googled?"</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Above all: be friendly, outgoing, and supportive, and help students learn to think like a developer.</strong></p>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.</p>
