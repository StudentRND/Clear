Hi {{ user.first_name }},

Thanks for joining us as an evangelist for CodeDay {{ managed_batch.name }}! You're in for a very rewarding and very, very fun weekend. Before that happens, it's time to gear up!


# Training

One of the first things you'll need to do as an Evangelist is read our Evangelism Guide, available at https://code-evangelist.training.srnd.org/

**You need to read through this document in full in the next week.** This is one of the most important resources for CodeDay evangelism: it's based on the notes of hundreds of past CodeDay Evangelists.


# Tools

You already have an s5 account, so you're ready to log into all our internal tools. One of the tools you'll find most useful is Clear -- the CodeDay management backend -- located at https://clear.codeday.org/.

Another tool to pay attention to: your StudentRND email, available at http://mail.studentrnd.org/. If you don't think you'll be checking it often, be sure to set up forwarding! We'll send out all useful evangelism information to this email.


# Flights

If you'll be flying out to CodeDay, we'll follow-up in the next day or so to collect availability and traveller information.

# Phone
{% if not user.phone %}

In order to successfully host the event, we need your contact phone number. On the day of the event, if any parents need to reach event staff, it will be routed to you. (We will not give out this number directly; it goes through our phone system.)

You can add your phone number on s5 -- https://s5.studentrnd.org/me/edit.
{% endif %}

# Let's Get Moving

There's not a lot of time, so you should get started on this right away!

Expect more information, including an invitation to a pre-CodeDay meeting, in the coming weeks!

Cheers!
The StudentRND Team
