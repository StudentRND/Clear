<p>Thank you for your interest in being a CodeDay mentor. Your application was accepted! Here's what you need to
    know about mentoring.</p>

<p>Your local CodeDay team might contact you to schedule a specific shift, otherwise you can arrive any time
    between 2pm and midnight on Saturday, {{ registration.event.starts_at|date('F j') }}. Please plan to stay for at
    least two hours.</p>

<p>Mentoring at CodeDay is different from mentoring at a traditional hackathon:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Many students will be total beginners. Expect to help students who are confused about basic concepts.</li>
    <li>Beginners will be afraid to ask you for help. You will need to be proactive in asking teams about problems.</li>
    <li>Teach students to think like a developer. Before answering a question, ask "how does your code work" and
        "what have you Googled?"</li>
</ul>

<p>We're looking forward to seeing you soon! Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>
