Hi {{ registration.first_name }},

I wanted to quickly reach out and thank you for registering for CodeDay. I'm Tyler, and I'm in charge of StudentRND, the non-profit that runs CodeDay.

About a week before the event, you'll get an email with some details about how to get to the venue, what to bring, etc. In the meantime, I just wanted to ask if you had any questions?

----

Also one more thing -- would you mind sharing CodeDay with your friends and teachers? This is really useful for two reasons:

1. CodeDay is more fun with friends :)
2. Our goal is to show people why coding is cool. Inviting your friends -- especially the ones who you wouldn't exepect to attend something with the word "code" in the name -- is a great way to show them why building something of their own design is awesome!

If it helps, we have some emails you can copy-and-paste, flyers, and videos here: http://wiki.studentrnd.org/display/CODEDAY/Attendees%3A+Sharing+CodeDay+with+Friends+and+Teachers

Thanks so much, {{ registration.first_name }}.

Cheers!
