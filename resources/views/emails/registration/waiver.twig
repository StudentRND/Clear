    <p>Hello there!</p>

    {% if parent %}
        <p>Your student has registered for CodeDay, and listed you as their parent or guardian. Before your student
           will be able to attend, you'll need to sign a waiver.</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>CodeDay is coming up soon, and I'm excited to meet you in person (as I am totally a human and not a bot).
           Before you can attend, you'll need to sign a waiver.</p>
    {% endif %}

    <p>You can sign the waiver here: <a href="{{ waiver }}">{{ waiver }}</a></p>
