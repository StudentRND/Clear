    <p>Hey {{ registration.first_name }},</p>

    <p>Thank you for helping out this CodeDay!</p>

    <p>We'd like to invite you to join our Slack! If you're not aware, Slack is a popular collaboration platform used
       by many companies. We use it to provide live chat between CodeDay attendees in cities across the US. It's a
       great way to stay in touch with attendees and other volunteers before, during, and after CodeDay.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to join us, please register at
       <a href="https://s5apps.studentrnd.org/slack">https://s5apps.studentrnd.org/slack</a>. (You will need to register
       for a StudentRND s5 account, which will let you sign into any other StudentRND services you might need in the
       future.)</p>

    <p>If you have any questions, please reply to this message.</p>

    <p>Cheers!<br />
        The CodeDay Team</p>
